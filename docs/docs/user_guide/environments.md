3. Enter the new environment name (**This is required**)

## Enabling/Disabling an environment

Deployable environments can be enabled and disabled. This might be a better option than deleting the environment if there
is historical data related to the environment that should be kept.

**Heads Up!** Enabling and Disabling can only be performed by administrators of the deployable system!

### Disable an environment

To disable an environment, find the row with the environment to be disabled, click the <img alt="disable" src="../../img/disable.png" width="40"/> button.

### Enable an environment

To enable an environment, find the row with the environment to be enabled, click the <img alt="enable" src="../../img/enable.png" width="40"/> button.

## Deleting an environment

Deployable environments can be deleted. Beware, however, that this will also delete all information related to that 
deployable environment

**Heads Up!** Deleting can only be performed by administrators of the deployable system!

To delete an environment, find the row with the environment to be deleted and click the <img alt="delete" src="../../img/delete.png" width="40"/> button.
