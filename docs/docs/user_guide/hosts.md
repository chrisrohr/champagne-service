1. Click the <img alt="action" src="../../img/add.png" width="40"/> button at the bottom of the screen
2. The create new host dialog will appear

    <img alt="New host dialog" src="../../img/create-host.png" width="300"/>

4. Enter the new host name (**This is required**)
5. Select any tags for the host (This is how components are linked to hosts).
6. Click Save to create the host

## Deleting a host

Hosts can be deleted. This will _only_ delete the host entry and will _not_ delete any of the components linked to that host.

**Heads Up!** Deleting can only be performed by administrators of the deployable system!

To delete a host, find the row with the host to be deleted and click the 3 vertical dots to open the action menu and select Remove Host
